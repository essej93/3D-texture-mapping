### 3D texture mapping
## Description
This was developed using OpenGL. Its intention was to demonstrate different mapping techniques for textures on 3d objects. It also demonstrates a method used to create a reflection/mirror effect on a reflective surface.
All shaders were written by me.

## Key Notes:
- A point light source was used to illuminate the room.
- Normal mapping was used on walls.
- Reflective surface was created using the stencil buffer and blending.
- Cube mapping was used to create the reflection on the torus object.
- Rotation animations were created for the torus to demonstrate the reflections and lighting.
- Perspective projections were used for the multiple view windows. User is able to move camera's to get different angles of the room.
